# plane-reservation-system
A program I did (sloppily) in my first year at college as a semester project for the OOP course

By sloppily I mean no separation of interfaces vs. implementations of class, methods, attributes etc. and a sloppy handling of system memory. Might work on it in the future. 

The program functions on the basis of a randomization of certain variables: occupiers of seats, number of seats occupied etc. The algorithm mostly works correctly, with some hiccups regarding the repetition of certain names, heights, weights and budgets.

The project aimed to better my understanding of OOP style of programming and proved as a great "first ever large project".
